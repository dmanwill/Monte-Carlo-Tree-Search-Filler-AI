# Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search-Filler-AI

Code and demo for creating a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based AI to play the iMessage GamePigeon "Filler" game.

A simulated gameplay using strictly the game code is demonstrated in the AI Evaluation and Simulated Gameplay python notebook. The gameplay demonstrates how to run the MCTS algorithm with its possible parameters. The notebook also contains the code used to generate the simulation results to evaluate the AI.

The gui folder contains the files and further instructions for running the GUI to play against the AI.
Note that you will also need the Python dependencies installed. Make sure you have at least Python 3.7 and that it is on your `$PATH`. Do
```
pip install numpy matplotlib
``` 
in order to install the dependencies. If you want to run the Jupyter Notebook as well, you will need to install [Jupter](https://jupyter.org/).
